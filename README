== Description
POpen4 provides the Rubyist a single API across platforms for executing a 
command in a child process with handles on stdout, stderr, stdin streams as well 
as access to the process ID and exit status. It does very little other than to 
provide an easy way to use either Ara Howard's Open4 library or the win32-popen3 
library by Park Heesob and Daniel Berger depending on your platform and without
having to code around the slight differences in their APIs. 

Consider this my first attempt at a response to 
{Daniel's request}[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/44ba016610fa8878]
for a consensus on the API back in 2005.

It is my hope that this project will be shortly absorbed or replaced with a 
better solution. POpen4 offers very little in the way of features or 
flexibility, but it does work across platforms without extra coding.
== Notes
Rather than adopting either Open4's API or win32-open3's (they differ in several
respects, but most obviously in the order in which streams are passed to the 
block) I am proposing a third API for couple of reasons. First, Open4 passes the
PID first and win32-open3 passes stdin neither of which seem to me to be the 
streams we are most likely to use when we don't need all four. POpen4 passes
stdout and stderr first so that when the others are not required we can omit
them from the block. Second, I thought it best to break everybody's code rather
than to be a drop in replacement on one platform and be a surprise on another.
No surprises--it's a new API on either platform.

== Installation

   $ gem install --remote --include-dependencies POpen4
   
Presently POpen4 ships in four platform specific gems:

  POpen4-0.1.0-unix.gem
  POpen4-0.1.0-win32-1.8.2-VC++7.gem
  POpen4-0.1.0-win32-1.8.4-VC++6.gem
  POpen4-0.1.0-win32-source.gem

Users of Linux, Unix, BSD, etc., will want the unix package. Ara's Open4 gem
is a dependency. Users of the Ruby One-Click Installer (OCI) will want to select
the gem appropriate their version of Ruby. The real issue here is compiler 
version. The wrong version will SEGFAULT due to some incompatibility somewhere
in the VC++ compiler or libraries (which I really wish we could resolve, 
but oh well). Others using a Windows platform but not the OCI will want to 
compile from source using last of these gems. Be sure to have your environment 
set up for doing a build before running <tt>gem install POpen4</tt>.

== Acknowledgements
Ara Howard, Park Heesob, Daniel Berger and others have done the real work. Many 
thanks to them for the many hours they have poured into sharing their work with 
the Ruby community at large.
