== 0.2.2 - 10-Feb-2006
* Methods now support block form, and all handles are automatically closed
  at the end of the block (via ensure).

== 0.2.1 - 27-Oct-2005
* Added a type check in the extconf.rb file and did some type mangling in
  order to handle rb_pid_t in a backwards compatible way.  In other words,
  you need this version to work with 1.8.3 or later.
