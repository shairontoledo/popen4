= Description
   An open3 library for Win32
	
= Synopsis
   require 'win32/open3'
	
   Open3.popen3('ver'){ |io_in, io_out, io_err|
      error = io_err.gets
      if error
         puts "Error: " + error.chomp
         exit
      end
      puts "Result: " + io_out.readlines.last.chomp
   }

= Module functions
Open3.popen3(command, mode='t', show=false)

Open3.popen3(command, mode='t', show=false){ |io_in, io_out, io_err| ... }

   Executes 'command', returning an array of three IO handles representing
   STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR, respectively.  In block form these IO handles
   are yielded back to the block and automatically closed at the end of the
   block.
	
   You may optionally pass a mode flag of 't' (text, the default) or 'b'
   (binary) to this method.
	
   If the 'show' variable is set to true, then a console window is shown.

Open4.popen4(command, mode='t', show=false)

Open4.popen4(command, mode='t', show=false){ |io_in, io_out, io_err, pid| ... }
   
   Executes 'command', returning an array consisting of three IO handles,
   representing STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR, respectively, as well as the PID
   of the newly generated process.  In block form these IO handles and pid
   are yielded back to the block and automatically closed at the end of the
   block.
	
   You may optionally pass a mode flag of 't' (text, the default) or 'b'
   (binary) to this method.
	
   If the 'show' variable is set to true, then a console window is shown.
	
= Notes
   This is a remake of Park Heesob's win32_popen package.  It has been reworked
   in order to make the API (nearly) identical to the Open3 package currently
   included in the Ruby standard library.
	
   For now only the popen3 and popen4 methods have been included.  In later
   releases we will probably add the popen2 and posix_popen methods back in.
