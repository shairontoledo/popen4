== Description
This package provides an Open3.popen3 implementation for Win32 systems

== Prerequisites
Ruby 1.8.0 or later
C++ compiler (if building from source)

== Notes
Not supported on Windows 95, 98, or ME.
This is a stripped down version of Park Heesob's win32_popen package.

== Installation
ruby extconf.rb
nmake
ruby test\tc_open3.rb (optional)
nmake site-install

== Developer's Notes
This is a repackaging of Heesob's win32_popen module.  The purpose for this is
to create a unified API.

The popen2 and posix_popen methods are not included in this release.  They
were originally part of the win32_popen module, but have been left out.
They will probably be added back in at a later date.

There are a couple of differences in the Windows version for open3 (which also
apply to open4) - the mode flag and the show flag.  For the mode, you can
specify either 't' (text, the default) or 'b' (binary) as a second
argument.  For the show flag, you can specify either true or false, which will
show the console window, or not, depending on the value you pass.  The default
is false.

== Known Issues
I have noticed that this package (and others) may segfault if you are using
the latest version of the Ruby 1-click installer and VC++ 6.0.  This appears
to be an issue between VC++ 7 (which the installer was built with) and VC++
6.0.  Your best solution is to either upgrade your C compiler or to rebuild
Ruby from scratch rather than using the installer.

You can also download a precompiled binary from the project site.  Look for a
file called 'open3-x.y.z-vc6.so' on the 'files' page, where 'x.y.z' is a
version number, if you want a binary that's compatible with Curt Hibbs one
click installer.
